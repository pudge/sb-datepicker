           this.state = {
               duration: 125.4 // Duration values are given in seconds.
           }
        }
        
        render(){
            
            return (    
                <DurationInput
                    value={ this.state.duration }
                    onChange={ new_duration=> this.setState({duration: new_duration}) }
                />
            );
