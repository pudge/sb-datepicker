Forked from https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker

Changes:

* new function: dateTimeToTime
    * creates a "time" object (selectedTime) that is a Date object set to June 1, so all hours/minutes are valid
* new functions: setDateTimeFrom*
    * setDateTimeFromDate: sets hours and minutes on a Date object, from a Date object
    * setDateTimeFromString: sets hours and minutes on a Date object, from a date string
    * setDateTimeFromHHMM: sets hours and minutes on a Date object, from hours and minutes
* new property on DatePicker, Calendar, Time: selectedTime
* changed function: safeDateFormat
    * now uses optional selectedTime property to create a formatted datetime string using hybrid of the two dates, one for date and one for time
* new exports: dateTimeToTime, setDateTimeFromDate, setDateTimeFromString, setDateTimeFromHHMM, safeDateFormat


New behavior:

* DatePicker shows times using selectedTime, so all hours show in picker, regardless of DST; and formatted date input shows hours that might be missing because of DST
    * selectedTime value is set on object and passed through to constructors of other objects, and updated on changes
        * caller sets in DatePicker constructor
        * DatePicker sets in Calendar constructor
        * Calendar sets in Time constructor
    * On change (parsing field, or selecting time in picker, etc.), selectedTime is saved in properties, and is updated in the caller via onChange (SBDatePicker)
    * DatePicker sets selectedTime from state in Calendar (WrappedCalendar) object
    * Calendar sets selectedTime in Time object
    * Time object uses selectedTime (if set) for selecting the set time in list

Bugs:
* no known bugs
