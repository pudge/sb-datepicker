Forked from https://github.com/wysRocket/sb-datepicker

Changes:
* Remove all duration/delay code
* Remove formatting cruft
* Fix bug for empty minDate/maxDate generating warnings
* Formatted date for oteCallback uses safeDateFormat from react-datepicker-tz
* Set timeIntervals to high value (100,000) so we never have the system setting the (possibly invalid, out-of-order) times
    * this is a bug in react-datepicker that treats injected times differently from timeIntervals times, so they are sometimes off by an hour from each other, and out of order
* injectTimes skip times that are duplicated
* filterTime ignore undef times
* on change in DatePicker, receive selectedTime (in addition to selectedDate), and sends combined formatted datetime to callback

Bugs:
* In the callback, calling .update() on another datepicker messes up the state of the first datepicker, showing the original datetime; to get around this, we put a small delay on the .update() calls


TODO:
* verify tz support: we maintained multiple tz support, but largely untested, since currently only using single tz
* repeat / test build process
